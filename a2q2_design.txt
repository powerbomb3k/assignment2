1) -> 
	the file must be opened first

2) ->
	a variable to store a list 

3) ->
	a for loop to get the data from the file and append to a list
	These will be the co-ordinates

4) ->
	a for loop to go through the list 

5) ->
	a variable to store the initial base value, (0,0) in terms of a graph
	can be a list of two elements

6) ->
	another for loop to iterate through the value to each index

7) -> 
	using if / else statements to compare the values and and getting the output accordingly

8) ->
	a print statement to print the output


Pseudo-code::
	file open
	variable = []
	for I in file
		variable.append(i.strip())

	for I in variable:
		another variable
		for j in I:
			code consisting of if/else statements

		print statement
